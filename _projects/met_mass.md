This is more detailed in my presentation of [RMASB 2019](https://gbruening.github.io/presentations/RMASB2019).

In a nutshell, we wanted to determine if metabolic cost of arm reaching could predict the preferred reaching durations of people making reaching movements. The metabolic cost minimum turned out to not be a very good predictor of preferred movement duration. A utility model, however, can predict the preferred movement duration very well.
