Organizing labs for biomechanics.

I was a teaching assistant for the biomechanics capstone class in the Integrative Physiology department. My primary role was as lab coordinator, to make sure that all materials for the lab sections were prepped and ready to go.

The labs we created/modified for students were:
1. Axes and Planes
2. Muscle Mechanics
3. Tendon Mechanics
4. Angular Kinematics
5. Locomotion Kinematics
6. Center of Mass
7. Ground reaction forces
8. Bike Aerodynamics
9. Torque
